One player takes on the role of a newscaster, while the other player remixes news footage. This game was developed by [Lukas Hulsbergen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukashulsbergen) and [Victor de Boer](http://victordeboer.com) as part of Lukas' BSc. research project 's thesis.\r\n\r\n**[Play IetsNieuws now!](http://tinyurl.com/ietsnieuwsgame)**\r\n\r\n![Three phases of the game](http://biktorrr.github.io/ietsnieuws/images/screen123.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Find out more about IetsNieuws\r\n* Watch a screencast of the game https://youtu.be/eyb5sQyk244\r\n* Watch players play the game https://youtu.be/64xi63d9iCc\r\n* Play the game at http://tinyurl.com/ietsnieuwsgame\r\n* Have a look at the code (see github links above)\r\n* Read Lukas' thesis abstract (below)\r\n![](http://biktorrr.github.io/ietsnieuws/images/exp_screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThis research-project describes an experiment in which examines how\r\ntwo players experience the relationship between each other when\r\nplaying an asymmetric game on a split screen in the presence of an\r\naudience. This relationship is defined as competitive or cooperative.\r\nThis research is done by means of an experiment in which a group of\r\nsubjects was invited to play the game \"Iets Nieuws\" in a living room.\r\nThis game is designed with an asymmetrical style of play where the\r\nobjective is to mix video fragments (player one) of the nostalgic\r\ndutch news show “Polygoonjournaal” by means of a computer keyboard and\r\nto comment on the video (player two) through a microphone. The\r\nsubjects who weren’t playing fulfilled the role of audience. The\r\nsubjects were young adults and friends of each other. During the\r\nexperiment, there were different forms of interaction, both between\r\nthe audience and the players as well as between the players\r\nthemselves. Because of the limited game explanation in which only the\r\nbasics of the game were explained, the players created their own style\r\nof play which is called “emergent gameplay”. This meant that the\r\nplayers created their own goals aside from the original goal of the\r\ngame “to be as good as Philip Bloemendal”. These created goals were\r\nnot defined by the game itself. The results of the  observations\r\nduring the experiment and feedback through a questionnaire at the end\r\nof the experiment show that the subjects saw the other player as a\r\nteam player and not as an opponent. This means that the game in its\r\npresent form has a cooperative orientation. It also showed that the\r\naudience has an impact on how players play the game. However, this did\r\nnot apply to competitiveness, but rather on the above mentioned\r\nuser-created goals. This experiment has introduced a new application\r\ncontaining the aspects mentioned above and provides a basis to further\r\ndevelop this application and to further investigate these aspects.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
