<p>This research-project describes an experiment in which examines how
two players experience the relationship between each other when
playing an asymmetric game on a split screen in the presence of an
audience. This relationship is defined as competitive or cooperative.
This research is done by means of an experiment in which a group of
subjects was invited to play the game "Iets Nieuws" in a living room.
This game is designed with an asymmetrical style of play where the
objective is to mix video fragments (player one) of the nostalgic
dutch news show “Polygoonjournaal” by means of a computer keyboard and
to comment on the video (player two) through a microphone. The
subjects who weren’t playing fulfilled the role of audience. The
subjects were young adults and friends of each other. During the
experiment, there were different forms of interaction, both between
the audience and the players as well as between the players
themselves. Because of the limited game explanation in which only the
basics of the game were explained, the players created their own style
of play which is called “emergent gameplay”. This meant that the
players created their own goals aside from the original goal of the
game “to be as good as Philip Bloemendal”. These created goals were
not defined by the game itself. The results of the  observations
during the experiment and feedback through a questionnaire at the end
of the experiment show that the subjects saw the other player as a
team player and not as an opponent. This means that the game in its
present form has a cooperative orientation. It also showed that the
audience has an impact on how players play the game. However, this did
not apply to competitiveness, but rather on the above mentioned
user-created goals. This experiment has introduced a new application
containing the aspects mentioned above and provides a basis to further
develop this application and to further investigate these aspects.</p>
